# Introduction to ROOT CERN as an analysis tool for particle physics

## Instructor:

Gustavo Alejandro Loachamin Ordoñez

BSc in Physics, University of British Columbia, Canada

MSc in Physics (Fields and Elementary Particles), PUC Rio de Janeiro, Brasil

## Short description:

Research in physics requires the use of not only statistical tools but also computational to manage and handle the analysis of data sets. In particular for research in high-energy particle physics, the ROOT-CERN is a framework used for data analysis because of its graphical interface and its capability to analyze large sets of data. ROOT is also equiped with a C++ compiler, making the analysis efficient.
When introducing new students to particle physics research, this framework is not entirely explained or understood. The main goal of this workshop is to provide an easy way to understand the tools provided in this framework.
